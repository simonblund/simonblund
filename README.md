# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Simon

I'm a full stack software engineer.
I work most comfortably with Java / Spring Boot, TS, ~~Vue / Nuxt~~ **Svelte** and Cloudflare workers.

ðŸš‘ I have a special interest in enhancing the way emergency services work and to improve the services they can provide the community.

A big fan of [DDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DomainDrivenDesign.html), IaC and anything written by [Nicole Forsgren and the gang]()https://nicolefv.com/).
